    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <div id="web-security-answer">
      <p>I would first start with making sure that the companyâ€™s employs have had a introduction to identifying malicious threats. And maybe advise a refresher course as it is easy to forget.</p>
      <p>Then I would look at how the site receives data, and make sure that it is in the right format and advice using a third-party solution like NodeJS. 
        I would also explain that the authentication is harder to crack if they are using signature logins from for example OneLogin or Okta.
        </p>
        <p>I would advice using continuous Integration such as GitHub Action or Jenkins, that will help in maintaining the reliability of new work being pushed and help catch oversights coming from new code. 
          I would also advise a potential client to check how they handle user login and maybe advise a more secure approach to how they handle user credentials.
          </p>
          <p>Then finally I would suggest checking the page true a third party that offers vulnerability scans such as pentest-tools.com, they offer a free version and a paid version.</p>
